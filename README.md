Reprouction number, R, is the number of secondary cases generated by a single individual over its entire infectious period in a complete susceptile population , which is commonly used to characterize pathogen transmissibility during a epidemic. The monitoring of R over time provides the feedback on the effectiveness of interventions.
As aformentioned, the value of generation time was substituted with the serial interval distribution. the generation.time function can creat a discretized generation time distribution, which based on the tiem interval to choose. Two types of distribution can be used: Emperical distribution and Parametric distribution. The former requires the full specification of the distribution, 
however, the latter includes thress methods (gamma, lognormal and weibull distribution) and need the mean and standard deviation information.
Aterlatively, you can use the maximum likelihood method on the observed time intervals between the symptom onsets in primary cases and secondary cases. 
The est.GT function do solve the process.
